# WorldEditAdditions Changelog
It's about time I started a changelog! This will serve from now on as the main changelog for WorldEditAdditions.

Note to self: See the bottom of this file for the release template text.


## v1.15: The untitled update (unreleased)
- Added the optional argument `all` to [`//unmark`](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#unmark)
- Added a (rather nuclear) fix (attempt 4) at finally exterminating all zombie region marker walls forever
	- This is not a hotfix to avoid endless small releases fixing the bug, as it's clear it's much more difficult to fix on all systems than initially expected
- Added [`//nodeapply`](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#nodeapply), a generalisation of [`//airapply`](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#airapply) that works with a defined list of nodes. Check out [the reference](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#nodeapply) - it has some cool tricks to it! (thanks for suggesting, @kliv91 from the Discord server!)
- Added [`//ngroups`](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#ngroups), which lists the groups that a given node is a member of. Useful when paired with [`//nodeapply`](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#nodeapply)!
- Added [`//rotate+`](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#rotate) rotate regions through arbitrary series of potentially non-axis-aligned rotations.

### Bugfixes and changes
- Don't warn on failed registration of `//flora` → [`//bonemeal`](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#bonemeal) if the `bonemeal` mod isn't installed (e.g. in MineClone2) - thanks @VorTechnix in #106


## v1.14.5: The multipoint update, hotfix 5 (1st August 2023)
- Fix a bug where creative players in survival couldn't punch out position markers
- Added [`//listentities`](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#listentities), which lists all currently loaded `ObjectRef`s. This is intended for debugging mods - thanks to @Zughy in #103


## v1.14.4: The multipoint update, hotfix 4 (31st July 2023)
- When any segment of the marker wall is punched, unmark the entire wall - thanks to @Zughy in #102


## v1.14.3: The multipoint update, hotfix 3 (18th July 2023)
- Fix regions not remembering their state and being unresettable


## v1.14.2: The multipoint update, hotfix 2 (15th July 2023)
- Fix crash in `//subdivide`, again due to the new position system


## v1.14.1: The multipoint update, hotfix 1 (12th July 2023)
 - Fix issue #100, which caused a crash as `//pos1` and `//pos2` allowed non-integer positions to be set


## v1.14: The multipoint update (11th July 2023)
 - Add `//dome+`, which allows you to change the direction the dome is pointing in, and also create multiple domes at once
 - Add `//metaball`, which renders 2 or more [metaballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs) in Minetest
 - Significant backend refactoring to tidy things up
 - Add new multi-point selection wand ![A picture of the multi-point wand](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbrl/Minetest-WorldEditAdditions/main/worldeditadditions_farwand/textures/worldeditadditions_multiwand.png) to select many points at once.
 - Implement custom region boxing UI, which replaces the WorldEdit region box when using WorldEditAdditions wands.
 	- Is backwards compatible with regular WorldEdit wands and tools, as WorldEditAdditions keeps the new positioning system in sync with WorldEdit's.
	- The new multipoint wand required this as a prerequisite
 - Add [`//pos`](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#pos), for setting any numbered point (i.e. not just pos1 and pos2, but pos3 and beyond)
 - Add [`//spline`](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#spline), for drawing curved lines with an arbitrary number of points **(uses the new multi-point wand)**
 - Add [`//revolve`](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#revolve), which makes multiple evenly-spaced rotated copies of the defined region **(uses the new multi-point wand)**
 - [`//copy+`](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#copy), [`//move+`](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/#move):
	- Added support for integrated `airapply` mode, which replaces nodes at the target only if they are air - append `airapply`/`aa` to the command to use
	- Respect node rotation (i.e. param2) when copying/moving
	- Override `//move` and `//copy` by default

### Bugfixes and changes
 - Migrate from `depends.txt` to `mod.conf`
 - Cloud wand: fix typo in item description.
 - Commands that modify the terrain now ignore liquids
 - `//sculpt`:
 	- Fix undefined `default` brush
	- Change defaults to `circle`, `height=1`, and `brushsize=8`.
	- Change argument ordering to put `height` after `brushsize` instead of the other way around
 - `//hollow`: Fix safe region bug
 - Make `//pos1`, `//1`, `//pos2`, `//2`, `//mark`, `//unmark`, and `//reset` aware of the new WEA positioning system

     - Scale operations that scale up and down at the same time are split into 2 separate operations automatically (scaling up is always performed first)
 - `//count`: Make numbers human-readable
     - Tip: Use a monospace font for the chat window, and the columns will be aligned!
 - Add `//hollow` for hollowing out areas (a step towards parity with Minecraft WorldEdit)
 - `//subdivide`: Improve performance of initial chunk counting algorithm - it should get started on the job _much_ quicker now (especially on large regions)
 - `//subdivide`: Fix a bug where the entire defined region was emerged all at once instead of in chunks
 - `//subdivide`: Fix performance & memory usage issues
     - Fix passing arguments to the command being executed
     - If you encounter any other issues with it over large areas (particularly 2000x150x2000 and larger), please let me know

## v1.10: The tidyup update (16th January 2021)
 - `//maze`: Fix some parts of generated mazes staying solid
 - `//maze`, `//maze3d`: Allow non-number seeds (existing seeds aren't affected - they will still produce identical output)
 - `//many`: Improve format of progress messages, add ETA
 - `//subdivide`: Make asynchronous, and use `minetest.emerge_area()` to ensure areas are loaded before executing on a subdivision chunk
     - This will ensure that `//subdivide`ing enormous regions should now function as expected. Want to level an entire rainforest with `//subdivide` and `//clearcut`? Now you can! :D
 - Add `//line` for drawing simple lines


## v1.9: The Nature Update (20th September 2020)
 - Add `//many` for executing a command many times in a row
 - Add **experimental** `//erode` command
 - Add `//fillcaves` command - fills in all air nodes beneath non air-nodes

 - Add `//ellipsoidapply`: Like `//cubeapply`, but clips the result to an ellipsoid that is the size of the defined region.
 - Fix some minor bugs and edge cases
 - `//subdivide`: Print status update when completing the last chunk
 - `//count`: Optimise by removing nested `for` loops


## v1.8: The Quality of Life Update (17th July 2020)
 - Update `//multi` to display human readable times (e.g. `2.11mins` instead of `126600ms`)
 - Far wand: Notify player when setting pos1 and pos2
 - Make timings more accurate (use `minetest.get_us_time()` instead of `os.clock()`)
 - Add _experimental_ `//subdivide` command
 - Attempt to fix a crash on startup due to a dependency issue (#21)


## v1.7: The Terrain Update! (21st June 2020)
 - Added `//layers` (like WorldEdit for Minecraft's `//naturalize`)
 - Added `//convolve` (advanced terrain smoothing inspired by image editors)
 - Added far wand (like the regular WorldEdit wand, but with a configurable range that can extend to 100s of blocks)

## Updating
Updating depends on how you installed WorldEditAdditions.

 - UI in Minetest: There should be an update button for you to click in the mod menu
 - ContentDB: Download the latest update from [here](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Starbeamrainbowlabs/worldeditadditions/)
 - Git: `cd` to the WorldEditAdditions directory and run `git pull` (**Important:** Recently, WorldEditAdditions changed the default branch from `master` to `main`. If you're updating from before then, you'll need to re-clone the mod or else do some git-fu)

After installing the update, don't forget to restart your client and / or server.

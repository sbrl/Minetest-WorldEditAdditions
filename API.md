# API Reference
This file exists to give people looking for it convenient access to the various types of documentation WorldEditAdditions (WEA) provides.


## I'm a user of WorldEditAdditions
If you're using WEA in-game, you probably want the chat command reference:

 - [Interactive Chat Command Reference](https://worldeditadditions.mooncarrot.space/Reference/)
 - [Source file for the above in the git repository](https://github.com/sbrl/Minetest-WorldEditAdditions/blob/main/Chat-Command-Reference.md)

Remember: *Documentation, not code, defines what a program does.*

In other words, if the documentation ain't right, [open an issue](https://github.com/sbrl/Minetest-WorldEditAdditions/issues/new)!


## I'm a mod developer and I want to hook into WorldEditAdditions
That's awesome! WEA provides an extensive library of node and region manipulation functions. It also provides a significantly extensive library of utility functions - many of which Lua should provide built-in like Javascript.

The Lua API reference is built automatically from code comments using [moondoc](https://github.com/sbrl/moondoc). These code comments have been curated and written to ensure the docs are as detailed as possible. This is an ongoing process however, so if there are any issues with these docs, please get in touch.

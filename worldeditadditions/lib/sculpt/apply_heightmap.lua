-- @module worldeditadditions.sculpt


--- Applies the given brush at the given x/z position to the given heightmap.
-- Important: Where a Vector3 is mentioned in the parameter list, it reall MUST
-- be a Vector3 instance.
-- Also important: Remember that the position there is RELATIVE TO THE HEIGHTMAP'S origin (0, 0) and is on the X and Z axes!
-- @param	brush			table	The ZERO-indexed brush to apply. Values should be normalised to be between 0 and 1.
-- @param	brush_size		Vector3	The size of the brush on the x/y axes.
-- @pram	height			number	The multiplier to apply to each brush pixel value just before applying it. Negative values are allowed - this will cause a subtraction operation instead of an addition.
-- @param	position		Vector3	The position RELATIVE TO THE HEIGHTMAP on the x/z coordinates to centre the brush application on.
-- @param	heightmap		table	The heightmap to apply the brush to. See worldeditadditions.make_heightmap for how to obtain one of these.
-- @param	heightmap_size	Vector3	The size of the aforementioned heightmap. See worldeditadditions.make_heightmap for more information.
-- @returns	true,number,number|false,string		If the operation was not successful, then false followed by an error message as a string is returned. If it was successful however, 3 values are returned: true, then the number of nodes added, then the number of nodes removed.

-- TODO: Automatically find & register all text file based brushes in the brushes directory

-- TODO: Implement automatic scaling of static brushes to the correct size. We have scale already, but we probably need to implement a proper 2d canvas scaling algorithm. Some options to consider: linear < [bi]cubic < nohalo/lohalo

-- Note that we do NOT automatically find & register computed brushes because that's an easy way to execute arbitrary Lua code & cause a security issue unless handled very carefully

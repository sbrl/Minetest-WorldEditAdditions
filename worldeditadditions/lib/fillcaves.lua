-- @module worldeditadditions

--- Fill caves command. Fills underneath non-air nodes in the defined region.
-- @param	pos1		Vector3		pos1 of the defined region to fill caves in.
-- @param	pos2		Vector3		pos2 of the defined region to fill caves in.
-- @param	node_name	string		The name of the node to replace air nodes with. Should have been already normalised, as with all other worldeditadditions.* functions.
-- @returns	bool,{replaced=number}	1. Whether the fill caves operation was successful or not.
-- 									2. A table of statistics about the operation. Currently the only key in this table is `replaced`, which is the number of (air-like) nodes that were replaced during the operation.

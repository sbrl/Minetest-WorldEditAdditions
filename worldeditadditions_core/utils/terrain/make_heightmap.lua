-- @param	pos1	Vector		Position 1 of the region to operate on
-- @param	pos2	Vector		Position 2 of the region to operate on
-- @param	manip	VoxelManip	The VoxelManip object.

-- @param	data	table		The associated data object.
-- @return	table,table			The ZERO-indexed heightmap data (as 1 single flat array), followed by the size of the heightmap in the form { z = size_z, x = size_x }.
